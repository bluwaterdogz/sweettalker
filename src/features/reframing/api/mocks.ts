  "Been talking to this girl for weeks — real connection, late night convos, inside jokes, the works. Then out of nowhere, she stops replying. No fight, no closure, just silence. Makes you feel like maybe none of it was real to begin with.",
  "Nailed every question in this interview, felt like they loved me. They even hinted at salary. A week later I get a rejection email, no explanation. Feels like I got my hopes up for nothing, again.",
  "Had my birthday last weekend. Thought at least a few people would reach out or try to do something. Barely got texts, no one made plans. Ended up ordering takeout and watching Netflix alone.",
  "Tried opening up to my parents about how burned out I feel, how stuck I’ve been. They just told me to work harder and be grateful. Makes you feel like you're screaming into a void.",
  "All my friends are coupled up now. I’m always the one walking behind them or sitting across from two people holding hands. It’s not that I hate being single — I just don’t want to feel like a background character in everyone else’s life.",
  "Saw my ex post a picture with someone new. We broke up less than a month ago. I’m over here still trying to breathe through it, and she’s already smiling with someone else.",
  "I pour everything into my job, stay late, fix messes, go above and beyond. No one notices. No raise, no thank you, just more tasks. Feels like I’m slowly disappearing into my own desk.",
  "Every time I try to plan something — a hang, a catch-up, anything — people bail or say they’re busy. I’m starting to wonder if they even want me around or just say yes out of guilt.",
  "I wake up with a list of things I need to do, but I just can’t start. I sit there staring at my phone or a blank screen for hours. Then the guilt hits, but it doesn’t help — it just makes it worse.",
  "I went out of my way to help a friend through something really hard — stayed up late, checked in, dropped everything. When I hit a rough patch, they went quiet. Makes you feel stupid for caring so much.",
