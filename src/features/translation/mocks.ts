  //(F) – Feeling unheard, desperate to be understood
  "No, it's fine — really, don't worry about it. I just talk to hear myself anyway, right? God forbid you actually look up when I say something that matters.",
  //(M) – Wants connection, feels emotionally exiled
  "I don't even know why I try anymore. You're just gonna brush me off like always — like I'm the needy one just because I want a moment with you.",
  //(F) – Jealous, insecure, covering it with sarcasm
  "Wow, you have so much energy for everyone else. Must be exhausting, making all those other people feel special.",
  //(M) – Feeling unappreciated, spiraling into resentment
  "Do you even notice the stuff I do around here? Or does it just magically get done by the invisible house goblin you forgot you live with?",
  //(F) – Deeply lonely, but masking it in anger
  "I honestly don't even know who I'm dating anymore. You're just this... shell that floats in and out of the room. When did I become so easy to ignore?",
  //(M) – Sexually rejected, but avoids saying it outright
  "I guess I'll just keep pretending I don't notice how you flinch away every time I touch you. That's totally normal and fine.",
  //(F) – Tired of shouldering emotional labor
  "It's cute how I'm basically your emotional manager and housekeeper and therapist and backup plan, but somehow I'm the one who's 'too emotional' when I lose it.",
  //(M) – Lost, overwhelmed, borderline hopeless
  "I don't even know how to talk to you anymore without it turning into something. Maybe we're just better at pretending than actually being okay.",
  //(F) – Trying to get a response, any response
  "You could at least pretend to care. Like throw me a half-hearted 'that sucks' or something so I don't feel like I'm screaming into a void.",
  //(M) – Abandoned in small daily ways
  "You leave the room when I walk in. You pick up your phone the second I try to talk. It's not dramatic — it's just the slow bleed of being slowly erased.",
  //(F) – Sarcastic bid for quality time
  "Wow, you're free for 20 minutes this week? Should I book an appointment or do I just get whatever scraps fall off your calendar?",
  //(M) – Emotionally abandoned but trying to stay calm
  "I used to feel like we were a team. Now I just feel like a weird extra in a life you're barely letting me visit.",
  //(F) – Angry about being shut out emotionally
  "You say you're 'just tired' or 'don't want to talk about it' but somehow have deep conversations with literally everyone else. Just not me, I guess.",
  //(M) – Passive-aggressive bid for validation
  "Nah, it's cool. I'll just keep guessing what you actually want and then still be wrong and get glared at.",
  //(F) – Frustrated about being dismissed or talked over
  "It's wild how fast you interrupt me. Like, it's honestly impressive. I must just be talking for sport at this point.",
  //(M) – Wants to feel desired, but feels invisible
  "I miss when you used to actually look at me. Now you look through me like I'm just... part of the furniture.",
  //(F) – Resentful about one-sided emotional care
  "You're allowed to have breakdowns. I'm not even allowed to be slightly off without it being a problem. How is that fair?",
  //(M) – Jealous, insecure, and afraid to say it plainly
  "It's just funny how lit up you get when you're talking to him. Like, I forgot what that version of you even looked like with me.",
  //(F) – Sarcastic complaint masking need for help
  "Sure, I'll do the laundry, dishes, groceries, texts, planning, and emotional tracking — because clearly it's just easier if I handle everything, right?",
  //(M) – Frustrated, bitter, shut down
  "I'm tired of trying to talk about things that matter. You either change the subject or act like I'm overreacting. So yeah, maybe silence is easier.",
